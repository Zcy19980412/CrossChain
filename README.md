# Cross-Chain Asset Exchange Platform

## Overview

The Cross-Chain Asset Exchange Platform is a simplified simulation of a cross-chain bridge protocol inspired by the intents-based architecture (as seen in protocols like Across). The platform demonstrates key concepts behind cross-chain interoperability, including asset deposit, swap order creation, event-driven cross-chain verification, and a settlement layer that releases funds to relayers upon successful execution.

## Features

- **User Registration & Asset Deposit:**  
  Users can register and deposit ERC20 tokens into the system.

- **Cross-Chain Swap Request:**  
  Users initiate a cross-chain asset swap by freezing their tokens on the source chain and creating a swap order.

- **Event-Driven Verification:**  
  The platform simulates cross-chain communication by emitting and listening to events to verify that the swap has been executed.

- **Settlement Layer:**  
  User funds are escrowed and are only released to the relayer (simulated) once the swap is successfully verified.

- **Simulated Relayer Network:**  
  A simplified mechanism represents competitive relayers that fulfill swap orders quickly.

- **Optional Front-End Interface:**  
  A basic UI (built with React/Vue) can be implemented to allow users to interact with the contracts, check balances, and monitor swap statuses.

## Architecture

The system is organized into three main layers:

1. **Request for Quote Mechanism:**  
   Users specify their desired outcomes (e.g., swapping one asset for another) without needing to know the underlying technical steps. This creates a swap order.

2. **Network of Competitive Relayers:**  
   A simulated decentralized network of relayers listens for events from the source chain, competes to fulfill swap orders, and executes the required operations on the target chain.

3. **Settlement Layer:**  
   This layer escrows user funds, performs the necessary verifications to ensure that the swap has been completed, and releases payments to the relayers.

## Technologies

- **Solidity:** Smart contract development.
- **Hardhat/Truffle:** Development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts.
- **ERC20 Standard:** For token implementation and simulation.
- **Web3.js/Ethers.js:** For contract interaction (if integrating a front-end).
- **React/Vue (Optional):** For building the user interface.
